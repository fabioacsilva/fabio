## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

My name is FÃ¡bio Silva and I am a software engineer from Portugal. I started working as a Fullstack Engineer in 2017 and since 2018 I have been mostly dedicated to Backend development. I focus on scaling systems up and shipping reliable applications! The majority of my experience is with JVM, but I'm up for any challenge. I'm also interested in Site Reliability Engineering & Infrastructure!

ðŸŒ± I love learning
