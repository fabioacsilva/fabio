## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

My name is FÃ¡bio Silva and I am a software engineer from Portugal. I started working as a Fullstack Engineer and since 2018 I have been mostly focused in backend development. I have acquired my taste for coding while I was taking my Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I love working with Java and Kotlin, and I strive to keep on learning new stuff!

I love to read technical books ðŸ¤“

If you would like to know a bit more about me and what technologies I worked reach out to me via LinkedIn ðŸ˜Š
