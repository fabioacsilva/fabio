## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Hello ðŸ˜€ ! My name is FÃ¡bio Silva and I am a software engineer from Portugal. I started working as a fullstack engineer and since 2018 I have been mostly focused in backend development. I have acquired my taste for coding while I was taking my Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering and since then I haven't stopped. I love read technical books ðŸ¤“

If you would like to know a bit more about me and what technologies I worked reach out to me via LinkedIn ðŸ˜Š
